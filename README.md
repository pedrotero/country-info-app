# SETUP

- You must have node and TypeScript installed to run both projects. You also need ts-node to execute TS without precompiling. To install, run "npm install -g ts-node" on your OS CLI.

- You also need to install concurrently, a node package for running multiple projects simultaneously. To do this, run "npm install" on the root folder.

- To run both the front and back end, simply run "npm run start:both" at the root folder after having done the steps above.

- To access the frontend, check the CLI output for the url(Example: "[1] - Local: http://localhost:3000"), access this url from your browser and you should see the country list page
